# Incubate 
A Trello like KANBAN tool to help manage you and your team. <br/>
This is currently a web-based application build using MERN stack with a potential for mobile developement.
<br/><br/>

## Objective
As mentioned, this is Trello like KANBAN application. So... how is this different? <br/> <br/>
Trello offers the basics functionality to manage and keep yourself on track. Incubate wanted to expand on that concept by offering more free elements.
I wanted to add the option such as tabs, voice chats, live conversations and so on. This is just a concept so this needs a lot more brainstorming and flushing out.
<br/><br/>

## Technolgies
I was think of using MERN stack as this application needs to visually appealing and requires functionality of React. 
<br/> The application will be utilizing technologies such as:
- MySQL
- Express JS
- React
- Node JS
<br/>
<b>Note: I'm well aware M in MERN stands for MongoDB.</b>
<br/><br/>

## Current Development
I'm currently looking into sockets.io rooms. Every board is going to have its own room for its conversation. Rooms are also going to be used to update views with the latest content.
When a team member makes changes to the database, the views need to be changed for other people currently on the board.
