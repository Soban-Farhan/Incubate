# Incubate 
A Trello like KANBAN tool to help manage you and your team. <br/>
This is currently a web-based application build using MERN stack with a potential for mobile developement.
<br/><br/>

## Objective
As mentioned, this is Trello like KANBAN application. So... how is this different? <br/> <br/>
Trello offers the basics functionality to manage and keep yourself on track. Incubate wanted to expand on that concept by offering more free elements.
I wanted to add the option such as tabs, voice chats, live conversations and so on. This is just a concept so this needs a lot more brainstorming and flushing out.
<br/><br/>

## Technolgies
I was think of using MERN stack as this application needs to visually appealing and requires functionality of React. 
<br/> The application will be utilizing technologies such as:
- MySQL
- Express JS
- React
- Node JS
<br/>
<b>Note: I'm well aware M in MERN stands for MongoDB.</b>
<br/><br/>

## Current Development
The development for board layout still continues but, the personal board creation function is complete. Next step is to start working on team board creating functionality. <br/>
I have also started to work on the tab functionality/design. Had a setup due to me getting sick but, now back to normal.
